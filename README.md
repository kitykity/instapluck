==========

<p>Create a primitive xml feed of your Instagram photos
<p>Note: This is designed to be run within a Mac Terminal window.
<ol><li>Go to your Instagram page in Google Chrome, and view your pictures. Scroll down and keep hitting "load more" until all your photos are loaded.
<li>Right click on a picture, and select "Inspect Element."
<li>Collapse all the levels (with the little arrows on the left) until all you can see is the <html> main tag.
<li>Right-click it, and select "Copy."
<li>Open your favorite text editor, and Paste all of the text. (This will probably take a while.)
<li>Save the file to a directory called instapluck, i.e. /Users/fred/instapluck, and call it export.html.
<li>Save the script on this GitHub page, instapluck.bash, to your new instapluck directory.
<li>Make it executable, run it, and enjoy!
</ul>
